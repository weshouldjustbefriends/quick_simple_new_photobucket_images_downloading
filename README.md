Quick code whip up for scrape your own Photobucket images. Have to go into the edit mode for your pics and then keep scrolling down and allowing javascript to load more of your images. Can keep doing it until all pics have loaded. Then have to save the html of the page.

A lot of the above could be coded as well.

And haven't checked how well this could work and/or be adjusted for public Photobuckets.
